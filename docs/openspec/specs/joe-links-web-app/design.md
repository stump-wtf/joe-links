# Design: joe-links Web Application

## Context

**Joe Links** is a self-hosted "go links" service — a riff on [Go Links](https://www.golinks.io/). Users create short memorable slugs (e.g., `jira`, `standup`) that redirect to long URLs. Visiting `https://joe-links.example.com/jira` instantly redirects to whatever URL `jira` maps to. The application is built on a Go + HTMX + DaisyUI/Tailwind stack with a pluggable relational database backend and OIDC-based authentication. The design prioritizes operational simplicity (single binary), developer clarity (explicit SQL, no ORM magic), and provider-agnostic identity (OIDC with local user sync). This document describes the high-level architecture and the rationale for key implementation decisions.

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals

- Deliver a production-ready Go web application scaffold with HTMX + DaisyUI
- Support SQLite (dev/single-node), MariaDB, and PostgreSQL interchangeably via runtime config
- Provide versioned, embedded, auto-applied schema migrations
- Implement OIDC authentication with a single configured identity provider
- Maintain a local `users` table with RBAC roles decoupled from OIDC claims
- Keep the compiled binary fully self-contained (assets, migrations, templates embedded)

### Non-Goals

- Username/password or magic-link authentication
- A full OIDC Identity Provider (this app is a Relying Party only)
- Multi-tenant isolation (single-tenant application)
- GraphQL or REST API endpoints for external consumers
- Real-time WebSocket features (future concern)

---

## Decisions

### CLI Framework

**Choice**: `spf13/cobra` + `spf13/viper` with `SetEnvPrefix("JOE")`
**Rationale**: Cobra is the de-facto standard for Go CLIs (used by kubectl, hugo, etc.) and gives us subcommands (`serve`, `migrate`) with auto-generated `--help`. Viper's `AutomaticEnv()` + `SetEnvPrefix("JOE")` means every config key maps to a `JOE_`-prefixed env var with zero boilerplate. An optional `joe-links.yaml` supports local dev without environment variable overhead.
**Alternatives considered**:
- `flag` stdlib: No subcommand support, no env prefix binding — rejected
- `urfave/cli`: Solid but smaller ecosystem; cobra is more familiar to Go operators

### HTTP Router

**Choice**: `chi` router (`go-chi/chi`)
**Rationale**: `chi` is lightweight, composable, and `net/http` compatible — it works with standard `http.Handler` middleware. It supports route groups and middleware chains cleanly, which maps directly to the auth middleware layering needed for RBAC.
**Alternatives considered**:
- `gin`: More opinionated, uses its own `Context` type which complicates middleware reuse
- `gorilla/mux`: Less actively maintained; `chi` is considered its modern successor
- `net/http` ServeMux (stdlib): Insufficient for route parameter extraction and middleware grouping

### Template Engine

**Choice**: Go's `html/template` with a base layout + block pattern, templates embedded via `//go:embed`
**Rationale**: Stdlib templates are safe (auto-escaping), well-understood, and require no dependencies. The block/define pattern allows HTMX partial responses to reuse the same templates as full-page renders. Embedding templates in the binary keeps deployment simple.
**Alternatives considered**:
- `Templ` (typed Go template DSL): Compile-time type safety is appealing but adds a codegen step; can be adopted later
- `Jet`, `Plush`: Third-party engines with richer syntax but at the cost of stdlib compatibility

### Database Query Layer

**Choice**: `jmoiron/sqlx` over `database/sql` directly
**Rationale**: `sqlx` extends `database/sql` with named queries, struct scanning, and `In()` slice expansion — all common needs — without hiding the SQL layer. Queries remain readable SQL strings. No ORM abstraction that generates unpredictable queries.
**Alternatives considered**:
- `sqlc`: Compile-time type-safe queries are attractive; deferred because it requires a separate code-generation step and has dialect edge cases with MySQL
- GORM: Rejected per ADR-0002 — `AutoMigrate` is unsafe for production and ORM abstraction obscures query behavior

### Migration Tool

**Choice**: `pressly/goose` with `go:embed` for migration files
**Rationale**: `goose` is mature, supports all three target databases natively, and can be run programmatically at startup. Embedding migrations in the binary means no external migration files are needed in production. `goose` tracks applied migrations in a `goose_db_version` table.
**Alternatives considered**:
- `golang-migrate/migrate`: Also solid; goose chosen for better programmatic API and SQL-only migration file support
- Custom migration runner: Reinventing the wheel; rejected

### Session Store

**Choice**: `alexedwards/scs` with a database-backed store (the application DB)
**Rationale**: SCS is a lightweight, well-maintained session library with first-class support for `database/sql`-backed stores. Using the application database as the session store avoids a separate Redis/Memcached dependency for simple deployments. The store can be swapped to Redis for high-scale deployments without changing application code.
**Session lifetime**: 30-day absolute expiry; no idle timeout. Configured via `JOE_SESSION_LIFETIME` env var (default `720h`).
**Alternatives considered**:
- `gorilla/sessions` with cookie store: Cookie-based sessions cannot be server-side revoked; rejected for security
- `gorilla/sessions` with DB store: Less actively maintained than SCS; SCS has cleaner API

### Admin Role Assignment

**Choice**: Match `JOE_ADMIN_EMAIL` environment variable against the authenticated user's email on every sign-in (grant-only).
**Rationale**: Simple, operator-controlled, requires no seed data or separate bootstrap step. Env-driven admin configuration is **grant-only on any login**: if the signing-in user's OIDC email matches `JOE_ADMIN_EMAIL`, their role is set to `admin` during the upsert — including promoting a matching pre-existing user at every login. Env matching never demotes; demotion is only possible via the admin UI/API, and an env-granted user demoted there is re-promoted at their next login (the env var is authoritative for its grant).
**Group-based grants**: `JOE_OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS` (comma-separated OIDC group names) grants the `admin` role with the same grant-only-on-any-login semantics when the user's group claim intersects the configured list. The claim name defaults to `groups` and is configurable via `JOE_OIDC_GROUPS_CLAIM`.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Auto-assign admin to the first user ever: Fragile — depends on insertion order and can be a security issue in shared environments
- Admin promoted via CLI command: Requires operational tooling that isn't yet built

### OIDC Provider Count

**Choice**: Single provider at launch. Provider configuration is a flat set of env vars (`JOE_OIDC_ISSUER`, `JOE_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `JOE_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, `JOE_OIDC_REDIRECT_URL`).
**Rationale**: Keeps configuration simple and the auth code path linear. Multi-provider support can be layered on later by moving to a provider map keyed by a short name.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Multi-provider from day one: Adds routing complexity (which provider handles the callback?) without immediate need

### Identity Trust

**Choice**: Trust OIDC claims fully — no application-level email verification step.
**Rationale**: The OIDC provider is responsible for verifying user identity (including email ownership). Adding a second verification layer duplicates work and degrades UX without meaningful security gain for a single-provider setup.

### PKCE and State

**Choice**: PKCE (RFC 7636) is required for all authorization code flows; state is a random nonce stored in a short-lived pre-auth cookie
**Rationale**: PKCE protects against authorization code interception attacks even for confidential clients. State prevents CSRF on the callback. Both are stored in a `__auth_state` cookie that is deleted after the callback completes.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **SQL dialect differences** → Use a lowest-common-denominator SQL subset in application queries. Dialect-specific DDL (e.g., `AUTOINCREMENT` vs `SERIAL`) must be handled in migration files using goose's per-driver migration directories or conditional annotations.
- **goose embedded migrations + SQLite CGO** → `mattn/go-sqlite3` requires CGO; for CGO-free builds use `modernc.org/sqlite` as an alternative driver. Cross-compilation targets must account for this.
- **SCS DB session store performance** → For high-throughput deployments, the database session store may become a bottleneck. Mitigation: SCS supports swapping to a Redis store without changing application code.
- **OIDC provider downtime** → Existing authenticated sessions continue to work (they hit the local DB, not the OIDC provider). New logins will fail if the provider is unreachable. Mitigation: clear error messaging; consider local admin bypass in emergency scenarios.
- **RBAC simplicity** → Two-role (`user`/`admin`) RBAC is sufficient for initial scope but may need expansion. The `role` column design allows simple enum extension without schema changes for additional roles.

---

## Migration Plan

This is a greenfield project. The migration sequence at initial startup is:

1. `00001_create_users.sql` — creates the `users` table
2. `00002_create_sessions.sql` — creates the `scs_sessions` table (SCS database store schema)

Future migrations are added as sequential goose files in `db/migrations/`.
