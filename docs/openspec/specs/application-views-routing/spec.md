# SPEC-0004: Application Views and Routing

## Overview

This specification defines the complete set of application routes, views (pages), shared layout components, and HTMX interaction patterns for joe-links. It covers the slug resolver (the core go-link redirect), the authenticated user dashboard, link CRUD views, tag browsing, admin views, and the landing page.

See ADR-0007 (Application Views and Routing), ADR-0001 (Technology Stack), SPEC-0001 (Core Web App), SPEC-0002 (Data Model), SPEC-0003 (UI Theming).

## Requirements

### Requirement: Route Registration and Priority

The chi router MUST register all named routes before the catch-all slug resolver (`GET /{slug}`). The following path prefixes MUST be reserved and MUST take precedence over slug resolution: `auth`, `static`, `dashboard`, `admin`. Route-level authorization MUST be enforced via chi middleware groups, not inside individual handlers.

#### Scenario: Reserved Prefix Takes Precedence

- **WHEN** a request arrives at `/dashboard`
- **THEN** the dashboard handler MUST be invoked; the slug resolver MUST NOT be invoked

#### Scenario: Static Asset Served

- **WHEN** a request arrives at `/static/css/app.css`
- **THEN** the embedded static file server MUST respond with the CSS; the slug resolver MUST NOT be invoked

#### Scenario: Slug Resolved After All Named Routes

- **WHEN** a request arrives at `/foobar` and `foobar` is not a registered named route
- **THEN** the slug resolver MUST be invoked

---

### Requirement: Landing Page (`GET /`)

The landing page MUST be served at `GET /` without authentication. If the requesting user has a valid session, the server MUST redirect them to `/dashboard`. If unauthenticated, the page MUST render a hero section explaining go-links, a "Sign in" call-to-action button linking to `/auth/login`, and a brief description of the service.

#### Scenario: Unauthenticated Root Visit

- **WHEN** an unauthenticated user visits `/`
- **THEN** the landing page MUST be rendered with a sign-in CTA

#### Scenario: Authenticated Root Visit

- **WHEN** an authenticated user visits `/`
- **THEN** the server MUST issue a `302 Found` redirect to `/dashboard`

---

### Requirement: User Dashboard (`GET /dashboard`)

The dashboard MUST be served at `GET /dashboard` and MUST require authentication. It MUST display all links the authenticated user owns or co-owns, a search/filter input, a tag filter control, and a "New Link" button. Links MUST be displayed with their slug, title (or URL if no title), description excerpt, tag chips, and edit/delete action controls. An empty state MUST be shown when the user has no links, with a prominent "Create your first link" prompt.

#### Scenario: Dashboard Shows Owned Links

- **WHEN** an authenticated user with existing links visits `/dashboard`
- **THEN** all links where the user appears in `link_owners` MUST be listed

#### Scenario: Dashboard Empty State

- **WHEN** an authenticated user with no links visits `/dashboard`
- **THEN** a friendly empty state with a link-creation CTA MUST be rendered

#### Scenario: Dashboard Search

- **WHEN** an authenticated user types in the search field (HTMX `hx-get` with debounce)
- **THEN** the link list MUST be replaced with a filtered fragment matching the query against slug, title, and description

#### Scenario: Dashboard Tag Filter

- **WHEN** an authenticated user clicks a tag chip in the filter row
- **THEN** the link list MUST be replaced with links tagged with the selected tag

---

### Requirement: New Link Form (`GET /dashboard/links/new` and `POST /dashboard/links`)

The new link form MUST be accessible via `GET /dashboard/links/new` (full-page fallback) and as an HTMX modal (`hx-get="/dashboard/links/new" hx-target="#modal"`). The form MUST include: slug (required, live-validated), URL (required), title (optional), description (optional), tags (optional, with autocomplete). Submission MUST go to `POST /dashboard/links`. On success, the browser MUST be redirected to `/dashboard` with a success toast. On error, the form MUST be re-rendered with inline validation messages.

#### Scenario: Successful Link Creation

- **WHEN** an authenticated user submits a valid slug and URL
- **THEN** the link MUST be created and the user MUST be redirected to `/dashboard`

#### Scenario: Live Slug Validation

- **WHEN** an authenticated user types in the slug field
- **THEN** an HTMX request MUST fire (debounced 300ms) to `GET /dashboard/links/validate-slug?slug=...` and render an inline availability indicator

#### Scenario: Slug Taken — Inline Error

- **WHEN** live slug validation returns a taken slug
- **THEN** a red inline indicator MUST appear beside the slug field without submitting the form

#### Scenario: Form Validation Error on Submit

- **WHEN** a user submits the new link form with an invalid slug or missing required fields
- **THEN** the form MUST be re-rendered with inline error messages for each invalid field

#### Scenario: Tag Autocomplete

- **WHEN** a user types in the tag input
- **THEN** an HTMX request MUST fire (debounced 200ms) to `GET /dashboard/tags/suggest?q=...` and render a dropdown of matching tags

#### Scenario: Tag Write Failure Surfaces

- **WHEN** the link record is created but persisting its tags fails
- **THEN** the failure MUST surface to the user as an error; tags MUST NOT be silently dropped (applies equally to the edit form's tag updates)

---

### Requirement: Link Detail View (`GET /dashboard/links/{id}`)

A read-only detail page MUST be served at `GET /dashboard/links/{id}` for authenticated users who are owners, co-owners, or admins. Share recipients (users with a `link_shares` record for the link, SPEC-0010) MUST also be able to view the page read-only. It MUST display the full slug, URL (clickable), title, description, tags, the list of co-owners, a visibility badge in the header, and Created/Updated timestamps rendered in UTC with a UTC label. A copy button MUST copy the full go-link URL to the clipboard. Edit and Delete action buttons MUST be rendered for owners and admins only. Dashboard list rows MUST link to the detail page for any viewer with view access to the link.

#### Scenario: Detail View for Owner

- **WHEN** an authenticated owner visits `/dashboard/links/{id}`
- **THEN** the full link detail MUST be rendered with edit and delete controls visible

#### Scenario: Detail View Read-Only for Share Recipient

- **WHEN** a user whose only relationship to the link is a `link_shares` record visits `/dashboard/links/{id}`
- **THEN** the detail page MUST render without edit, delete, or share-management controls

#### Scenario: Detail View Forbidden for Non-Owner

- **WHEN** an authenticated user who is not an owner, co-owner, share recipient, or admin visits `/dashboard/links/{id}`
- **THEN** the server MUST return `403 Forbidden`

#### Scenario: Copy Go-Link URL

- **WHEN** a user clicks the copy button
- **THEN** `navigator.clipboard.writeText(fullGoLinkURL)` MUST be invoked and a success toast MUST appear

---

### Requirement: Edit Link Form (`GET /dashboard/links/{id}/edit` and `PUT /dashboard/links/{id}`)

The edit form MUST be served at `GET /dashboard/links/{id}/edit` for owners and admins. The `slug` field MUST be rendered as read-only. All other fields (URL, title, description, tags) MUST be editable. Submission MUST go to `PUT /dashboard/links/{id}`. On success, the browser MUST be redirected to the link's detail page.

#### Scenario: Slug Read-Only on Edit

- **WHEN** an owner visits the edit form
- **THEN** the slug input MUST be rendered as a read-only/disabled field and MUST NOT be accepted in the PUT request body

#### Scenario: Successful Edit

- **WHEN** an owner submits valid edits
- **THEN** the link MUST be updated and the user MUST be redirected to `/dashboard/links/{id}`

#### Scenario: Edit by Non-Owner

- **WHEN** a non-owner non-admin user submits a PUT to `/dashboard/links/{id}`
- **THEN** the server MUST return `403 Forbidden`

---

### Requirement: Delete Link (`DELETE /dashboard/links/{id}`)

Link deletion MUST be initiated via HTMX with a confirmation modal (DaisyUI modal component). The DELETE request MUST only be issued after user confirmation. On success, the link row MUST be removed from the DOM via HTMX swap and a success toast MUST appear.

#### Scenario: Delete with Confirmation

- **WHEN** an owner clicks delete and confirms in the modal
- **THEN** `DELETE /dashboard/links/{id}` MUST be sent; on 200 response the link row MUST be removed from the DOM

#### Scenario: Delete Cancelled

- **WHEN** an owner clicks delete but dismisses the confirmation modal
- **THEN** no DELETE request MUST be sent and the link MUST remain in the list

#### Scenario: Delete by Non-Owner

- **WHEN** a non-owner sends `DELETE /dashboard/links/{id}`
- **THEN** the server MUST return `403 Forbidden`

---

### Requirement: Co-Owner Management

Co-owners MAY be added via `POST /dashboard/links/{id}/owners` and removed via `DELETE /dashboard/links/{id}/owners/{uid}`. Both endpoints MUST be accessible to link owners and admins. The primary owner (`is_primary = TRUE`) MUST NOT be removable. After add or remove, the owners section on the link detail page MUST be updated via HTMX swap.

#### Scenario: Add Co-Owner

- **WHEN** an owner submits a valid user email via the add co-owner form
- **THEN** the user MUST be added to `link_owners` and the owners list fragment MUST be re-rendered

#### Scenario: Remove Co-Owner

- **WHEN** an owner clicks remove on a co-owner
- **THEN** the user MUST be removed from `link_owners` and the owners list fragment MUST be re-rendered

#### Scenario: Remove Primary Owner Blocked

- **WHEN** any user attempts to remove the primary owner
- **THEN** the server MUST return `400 Bad Request` with an error message

---

### Requirement: Tag Browser (`GET /dashboard/tags` and `GET /dashboard/tags/{slug}`)

A tag browser MUST be served at `GET /dashboard/tags` showing all tags with link counts. Clicking a tag MUST navigate to `GET /dashboard/tags/{slug}` which renders a filtered link list. Both views MUST require authentication.

#### Scenario: Tag Browser Lists All Tags

- **WHEN** an authenticated user visits `/dashboard/tags`
- **THEN** all tags with at least one link MUST be displayed with their link counts

#### Scenario: Tag Detail Shows Filtered Links

- **WHEN** an authenticated user visits `/dashboard/tags/engineering`
- **THEN** all links tagged with `engineering` that are visible to the user under SPEC-0010 (public links, links they own or co-own, and links shared with them via `link_shares`; admins see all) MUST be listed

#### Scenario: Tag with No Links

- **WHEN** a tag exists in `tags` but has no `link_tags` rows
- **THEN** it MUST NOT appear in the tag browser

---

### Requirement: Admin Dashboard (`GET /admin`, `/admin/users`, `/admin/links`)

Admin views MUST require the `admin` role, enforced by middleware. `GET /admin` MUST show summary statistics. `GET /admin/users` MUST list all users with their role, and role changes MUST be possible inline via HTMX `PUT /admin/users/{id}/role`. `GET /admin/links` MUST list all links across all users.

#### Scenario: Admin Accesses Admin Dashboard

- **WHEN** a user with role `admin` visits `/admin`
- **THEN** the admin dashboard MUST be rendered

#### Scenario: Non-Admin Blocked

- **WHEN** a user with role `user` accesses any `/admin/*` route
- **THEN** the middleware MUST return `403 Forbidden`

#### Scenario: Admin Changes User Role

- **WHEN** an admin submits a role change via `PUT /admin/users/{id}/role`
- **THEN** the user's role MUST be updated and the table row MUST be re-rendered via HTMX swap

---

### Requirement: Slug Resolver and 404 Page

`GET /{slug}` MUST be the last registered route. If the slug exists, the server MUST respond `302 Found` to the stored URL without authentication. If the slug does not exist, the server MUST render a friendly 404 page that includes the missing slug name, a "Create it now" button that pre-fills the slug in the new link form (requires auth; redirects to login if unauthenticated), and a search bar to find similarly-named links. Exception: the "Create it now" CTA MUST be suppressed for slugs reserved by expired or archived links — those slugs are still held by their links and cannot be re-created (SPEC-0020 REQs "Expired Link Resolution" and "Archived Link Resolution").

#### Scenario: Known Slug Redirects

- **WHEN** a request arrives at `/jira` and the slug `jira` exists
- **THEN** the server MUST respond `302 Found` with `Location` set to the stored URL

#### Scenario: Unknown Slug Renders 404

- **WHEN** a request arrives at `/foobar` and no link with slug `foobar` exists
- **THEN** the server MUST respond with a 404 page mentioning the slug and offering to create it

#### Scenario: 404 Create-It-Now

- **WHEN** an unauthenticated user clicks "Create it now" on the 404 page
- **THEN** they MUST be redirected to `/auth/login` with a redirect parameter that returns them to the new link form pre-filled with the slug

---

### Requirement: Shared Base Layout

All pages MUST use a base HTML layout template embedded via `go:embed`. Authenticated pages MUST include a navbar with: logo/wordmark, navigation links (Dashboard, Tags, Admin if role=admin), user avatar with a dropdown (sign out), and a theme toggle button. The layout MUST include an `id="modal"` target div for HTMX modal injection. The layout MUST include an `id="toast-area"` target for HTMX out-of-band toast notifications.

#### Scenario: Navbar Rendered for Authenticated User

- **WHEN** an authenticated user accesses any dashboard page
- **THEN** the navbar MUST include the user's display name and the theme toggle

#### Scenario: Admin Nav Link Shown Only to Admins

- **WHEN** a user with role `admin` views the navbar
- **THEN** an "Admin" link to `/admin` MUST be rendered

#### Scenario: Admin Nav Link Hidden for Non-Admins

- **WHEN** a user with role `user` views the navbar
- **THEN** no "Admin" link MUST appear in the navbar

#### Scenario: Toast Notification Delivered

- **WHEN** a handler returns an HTMX response with `HX-Reswap: outerHTML` on `#toast-area`
- **THEN** a toast notification MUST appear without a full page reload
