# SPEC-0016: Link Analytics and Prometheus Metrics

## Overview

joe-links currently records no data about link usage. This spec formalises the
requirements for click tracking, per-link analytics pages, a Prometheus metrics
endpoint, and REST API extensions for programmatic access to click data.
See ADR-0016 for the architectural decisions that govern this capability.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Click Recording

The resolver MUST record a click event for every successful redirect it issues.
A click event SHALL be inserted asynchronously via a buffered channel so that
the 302 redirect response is not blocked on the database write. The channel
buffer MUST be at least 256 events. Events that cannot be queued because the
channel is full MAY be dropped; the resolver MUST NOT block waiting for the
channel. The click writer goroutine MUST drain the channel on shutdown.

#### Scenario: Successful redirect recorded

- **WHEN** a request resolves a known slug and a 302 redirect is issued
- **THEN** a click event is sent to the buffered channel within the same request handler

#### Scenario: Full channel — drop, do not block

- **WHEN** the buffered click channel is full at the time of redirect
- **THEN** the click event is dropped and the 302 response is issued without delay

#### Scenario: Graceful shutdown drain

- **WHEN** the server receives a shutdown signal
- **THEN** the click writer goroutine finishes processing all queued events before the process exits

#### Scenario: Keyword redirects not recorded

- **WHEN** a request matches a keyword host or keyword path prefix and is redirected
- **THEN** no click event is recorded (keyword redirects are not link-owned slugs)

---

### Requirement: Click Data Schema

The `link_clicks` table MUST be created via a goose migration. Each row SHALL
represent a single click event and MUST contain:

| Column       | Type     | Constraints                                    |
|--------------|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| `id`         | TEXT/UUID | Primary key                                   |
| `link_id`    | TEXT/UUID | FK → `links.id` ON DELETE CASCADE             |
| `user_id`    | TEXT/UUID | FK → `users.id` ON DELETE SET NULL; nullable  |
| `ip_hash`    | TEXT     | SHA-256(client IP + daily salt); NOT NULL      |
| `user_agent` | TEXT     | App-truncated to 512 chars; nullable           |
| `referrer`   | TEXT     | App-truncated to 2048 chars; nullable          |
| `clicked_at` | DATETIME | UTC timestamp; NOT NULL                        |

The `user_agent` (512) and `referrer` (2048) length limits MUST be enforced in
the application layer at insert time, not as a database column constraint: the
columns are declared `TEXT` so the schema stays portable across SQLite, MySQL,
and PostgreSQL. Truncation MUST be rune-aware (count Unicode code points, never
split a multi-byte character).

A composite index on `(link_id, clicked_at DESC)` MUST be created to support
per-link recent-click queries without full table scans. The `user_id` column
MUST be set to the authenticated user's ID when the request carries a session,
and NULL otherwise.

The `ip_hash` MUST be computed as `SHA-256(clientIP + ":" + dailySalt)` where
`dailySalt` is derived from the current UTC date (format `YYYYMMDD`). The salt
MUST rotate at UTC midnight.

#### Scenario: Authenticated click

- **WHEN** a logged-in user clicks a link
- **THEN** the `user_id` column is set to that user's ID

#### Scenario: Anonymous click

- **WHEN** an unauthenticated request triggers a redirect
- **THEN** the `user_id` column is NULL and only `ip_hash` identifies the source

#### Scenario: IP hash rotation

- **WHEN** two clicks occur from the same IP address on different UTC dates
- **THEN** the `ip_hash` values are different (daily salt prevents cross-day correlation)

---

### Requirement: Prometheus Metrics Endpoint

The application MUST expose a Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint at
`GET /metrics` using `prometheus/client_golang` and `promhttp.Handler()`.
The endpoint MUST NOT require authentication. The following metrics MUST be
registered and updated:

| Metric name                             | Type      | Labels            | Description                               |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `joelinks_redirects_total`              | Counter   | `status`          | Total slug resolutions (`found`, `not_found`) |
| `joelinks_redirect_duration_seconds`    | Histogram | —                 | Time from request receipt to redirect response |
| `joelinks_clicks_recorded_total`        | Counter   | —                 | Click rows successfully written to DB     |
| `joelinks_clicks_record_errors_total`   | Counter   | —                 | Click insert failures                     |
| `joelinks_links_total`                  | Gauge     | —                 | Total links currently in the database     |
| `joelinks_users_total`                  | Gauge     | —                 | Total users currently in the database     |

The `joelinks_links_total` and `joelinks_users_total` gauges SHOULD be updated
on a background interval (e.g., every 60 seconds) rather than on every request.
A `slug` label MUST NOT be added to any counter or histogram (cardinality concern).

#### Scenario: Prometheus scrape

- **WHEN** Prometheus sends `GET /metrics`
- **THEN** the response is HTTP 200 with `Content-Type: text/plain; version=0.0.4` and all registered metrics in the Prometheus text exposition format

#### Scenario: Redirect counter increments

- **WHEN** a slug resolves successfully and a 302 is issued
- **THEN** `joelinks_redirects_total{status="found"}` increments by 1

#### Scenario: Not-found counter increments

- **WHEN** a slug lookup returns no result and a 404 is rendered
- **THEN** `joelinks_redirects_total{status="not_found"}` increments by 1

#### Scenario: Histogram records latency

- **WHEN** a redirect request completes
- **THEN** `joelinks_redirect_duration_seconds` records the elapsed time in seconds

---

### Requirement: Link Stats Dashboard Page

A per-link analytics page MUST be available at
`GET /dashboard/links/{id}/stats` within the authenticated dashboard. Only the
link's owner(s), co-owners, and admin users MAY access this page; all other
authenticated users MUST receive a 403 response; unauthenticated requests MUST
be redirected to the login page.

The page MUST display:

- Total click count (all time)
- Click count for the last 7 days
- Click count for the last 30 days
- A table of the most recent 50 clicks, showing: timestamp, referrer (or "—" if
  absent), and the user's display name if `user_id` is non-null (otherwise "anonymous")

The page MUST follow existing HTMX/DaisyUI conventions: full page render on
direct navigation, fragment render on HTMX request.

#### Scenario: Owner views stats

- **WHEN** an authenticated link owner navigates to `/dashboard/links/{id}/stats`
- **THEN** the stats page renders with totals and recent clicks

#### Scenario: Non-owner denied

- **WHEN** an authenticated user who is not an owner or admin navigates to `/dashboard/links/{id}/stats`
- **THEN** a 403 Forbidden response is returned

#### Scenario: Unauthenticated redirect

- **WHEN** an unauthenticated request reaches `/dashboard/links/{id}/stats`
- **THEN** the user is redirected to `/auth/login` with a `redirect` query parameter

#### Scenario: Link with no clicks

- **WHEN** the link has never been clicked
- **THEN** all counters display 0 and the recent-clicks table shows an empty state message

---

### Requirement: REST API Stats Endpoint

`GET /api/v1/links/{id}/stats` MUST return a JSON summary of click counts for the
specified link. The endpoint MUST require bearer token authentication (following
ADR-0009 conventions). Only link owners, co-owners, and admins MUST be authorised;
other authenticated callers MUST receive 403. A non-existent link MUST return 404.

The response body MUST conform to:

```json
{
  "link_id": "uuid",
  "total":   1024,
  "last_7d": 42,
  "last_30d": 310
}
```

#### Scenario: Owner fetches stats via API

- **WHEN** an authenticated link owner calls `GET /api/v1/links/{id}/stats`
- **THEN** a 200 response with the JSON stats summary is returned

#### Scenario: Unknown link

- **WHEN** the `{id}` does not correspond to an existing link
- **THEN** a 404 JSON error response is returned

#### Scenario: Unauthorized caller

- **WHEN** a valid bearer token is presented but the token owner is not an owner/admin of the link
- **THEN** a 403 JSON error response is returned

---

### Requirement: REST API Clicks Endpoint

`GET /api/v1/links/{id}/clicks` MUST return a paginated list of click events for
the specified link. The endpoint MUST support cursor-based pagination via an
optional `before` query parameter (a `clicked_at` ISO 8601 timestamp) and a
`limit` parameter (default 50, maximum 200). The response MUST include a
`next_cursor` field set to the `clicked_at` of the last item when more results
exist, and `null` when the page is the last page. Authorization rules are
identical to the stats endpoint.

Each item in the `clicks` array MUST include:

```json
{
  "clicked_at": "2026-02-27T12:00:00Z",
  "referrer":   "https://example.com",
  "user":       { "id": "uuid", "display_name": "Alice" }
}
```

The `user` field MUST be `null` for anonymous clicks. The `referrer` field MUST
be `null` when absent.

#### Scenario: Paginated fetch

- **WHEN** a caller requests clicks with `limit=10`
- **THEN** at most 10 click objects are returned and `next_cursor` is set if more exist

#### Scenario: Cursor pagination

- **WHEN** a caller passes `before=<cursor>` from a previous response
- **THEN** only clicks strictly before that timestamp are returned

#### Scenario: Anonymous click in list

- **WHEN** a click row has a NULL `user_id`
- **THEN** the `user` field in the API response is `null`
